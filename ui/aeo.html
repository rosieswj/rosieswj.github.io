              Our client American Eagle Outfitters used to be known to as a

            <p>
              American Eagle Outfitters is a popular clothing brand favored by
              college-aged young adults. However, it suffers from perceptions as
              a “middle school” clothing retailer in the eyes of 20-25 year
              olds. The company is currently seeking to attract a more diverse
              customer base and promote customer loyality. To gain deeper
              insights into the problem context and thus better serve our
              client, we took the following steps in our research structure:

              <br />
              When we visited the American Eagle store, we decided to focus our
              observations on the various touchpoints in interactions between
              the in-store associates and shopper. We saw that features on the
              the AEO application add little value to the in-store shopping
              experience: many customers aren't even aware of the app. There is
              also a mismatch between the role in-store associates and the
              expectations set by customers. Many customers find associates to
              be intimidating and are unwilling to seek help when they encounter
              sizing issues.

              We conducted competitive analysis on the servicescape of apparel
              retailers such as Sephora, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Lululemon. We
              found the common pitfalls for retailers is their inability to
              personalize shopping experience for all customers. Some customers
              feel marginizalied in the received service due to sizing issues,
              lack of privacy, and unpleasant associate interaction in store.
              <br /><br />
              Future innovations should focus on enhancing American Eagle’s
              accepting and associate engagement driven shopping experience
              while rehabilitating their image to increase traffic among 20-25
              year olds.

              <b>Storyboarding</b><br />
              We learned through our research that American Eagle carries many
              “online-only” sizes, which means that customers in need of these
              sizes are unable to try these jeans on before purchasing them.
              Consequently, they are left ordering several sizes of jeans,
              hoping one fits, and returning the other jeans. Moreover,
              customers are reluctant to share their sizing information with
              associates. We decided that this is a critical problem space that
              our service innovation should tackle.

              demographic of 20 to 25 year olds. Each participant was given a
              series of user tasks to complete as they experienced the TrueFit
              Studio like at an actual AEO store. Our research goals for the
              service enactments were to:<br />
              1. understand if users understand how to use our service<br />
              2. learn whether they get a sense of inclusivity and brand loyalty
              from using our service<br />
              3. observe how they interact with the mounted display when

              We envision <b>TrueFit Studio</b> to be a service in which users
              would walk into a fitting room that has all possible sizes of
              several styles jeans stacked for try-on. There would be minimal to
              no associate interaction involved in this process. Once the user
              finds a pair of jeans they like, they can proceed to checkout
              within the studio itself. They can use the mounted display to log
              into AEO Connected, choose what color jeans they want, and have
              the jeans delivered home.

              The most challenging part of the process is finding the 'point of
              entry' of innovation - what service can we bring to create new
              value, while minimizing potential risks of change? This requires a
              careful deconstruction of the existing system and thorough
              competitive analysis. The process of design also requires
              evaluation through different channels. It's difficult to get a
              service right, and it often takes many rounds of iterations and
              refinement. <br /><br />
              This project allows me to see design with me a pair of fresh eyes,
              because we are designing with methodologies specifically targeted
              at a service. It's very different from what I've done in the past
              with UX design and visual design. Design for service is more
              multifactorial: while user experience is at heart of our priority,
              we also need to consider risk management, competitive advantages,
              scope of implementation, the integrability into the current
              system, etc.
