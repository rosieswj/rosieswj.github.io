              Spotify is a digital music streaming service that offers music,
              podcasts, and videos on various devices. It was founded in 2006 in
              Sweden and was first launched in 2008. It provided a large music
              library, along with high-quality streaming on demand. Spotify
              changed people’s listening experience from files downloads to
              streaming in the cloud.

              <br /><br />
              In this project I studied how Spotify emerged and grew as a
              service by conducting PEST analysis, finding product opportunity
              gap (POG), and creating the value flow between stakeholders.
              <br /><br />
              This is one of my favorite projects because Spotify is my favorite
              digital service. Last year I spent 120k min on this platform and
              it has become a part of my daily routine. It's so interesting to
              view the platform from an 'insider' perspective and see how
              different socio-economic factors influenced its formation.

            </h2>
            <p>
              The most important factor to Spotify’s success is its ability to
              allow co-creation value for both artists and consumers. The
              service addresses pain points for both stakeholders and fill in
              the opportunity gap in the current market. When it was first
              launched in 2008, political, economic, social and technological
              factors all contribute to the formation of the service. However,
              legal and environmental factors did not have an immediate effect
              on the rise of Spotify.

                Government regulates licensing deals and music copyright more
                strictly. Spotify was able to reduce the workload of law
                enforcement to control online piracy because more users were
                drawn to legal music platform.

                Competitors such as Pandora radio and Soundcloud offer music
                streaming service but quality is not so great (only 64 kpbs for
                free users on Pandora). Record companies are generating more
                revenues from digital music (iTunes store, etc) than from
                records.
                <br />
                <br />
                A high-quality streaming service is on demand. Playback needs to
                be stable and at a higher speed. Record companies are seeking
                new channels to generate revenues, potentially through
                partnership with other services due to the ineffectiveness of
                traditional advertising model through radio. Independent, small
                artists need a platform to promote themselves and connect
                directly with the listeners.

              <h2>Social</h2>
              <p>
                Searching for music and catching up with new releases are
                time-consuming and slow for people. It’s difficult to. Free
                resources are often unreliable and the music quality is worsened
                by downloads. Paid service like iTunes is outrageously
                expensive. Music service needs to support an extensive library
                that allows more than just a “preview” of the song.
                <br /><br />
                The music library also needs to move to the cloud to free
                storage space on devices. Spotify recognized the need for
                cloud-based music library and sharing of music interest. People
                needed a service where they could truly access music on-the-go.

                Almost everyone owns a smartphone. Internet speed (4G network)
                has been significantly improved.
                <br /><br />
                More mobile phone usage means that people are listening more
                music on-the-go. There’s a need for accessing music directly
                from the mobile devices, without transfering downloads from the
                laptop. Increasing internet speed allowing faster and better
                quality download of music.

              Spotify’s MVP bridges the gap between users and artists. The key
              factors to Spotify’s formation include (1) demand for a fast and
              stable streaming service, (2) the need of artists for
              self-promotion and (3) increasing technological capacities.

              Spotify generates revenue mainly from premium subscription (90%).
              The other 10% comes from ads revenues on the platform. Both free
              and premium users have unlimited access to millions of songs in
              the Spotify library, while premium users receive ad-free streaming
              with personalized playlist.
