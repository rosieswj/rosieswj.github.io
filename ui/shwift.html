              Peer economy grows rapidly with the fast development of
              technology. Some well-known examples are Uber (car rides) and
              Airbnb (hotels).
              <br /><br />In this design challenge, we build a responsible web
              application, Shwift, to eliminate the painpoints in the process of
              shift swapping and improve the work efficiency for employees and
              relevant stakeholders at local restaurants. <br /><br />

              <b>Research</b>
              <br />
              We started our design by researching the problem domain. In this
              step, we went to local restaurants nearby neighborhoods and
              interviewed multiple restaurant owners, managers, and employees.
              After hearing about their experience with shift-swapping, we
              created user scenarios to reflect the current problems they are
              facing. These scenarios illustrate a co-production of values for
              different user groups. Along with personas, these scenarios help
              us model the real-world needs and wants of users, as well as the
              pain points in the current system of shift swapping.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br /><b>Stakeholder Map</b>
              <br />
              We identified three main groups of stakeholders: restaraunt
              owners, employees, and workers. All parties seeks different
              benefits from the system, and they exert different levels of
              influence on the implementation.
            </p>

              src="../Assets/images/ui/sw/swmap.png"
              alt="Shwift Stakeholders"
            />
            <p>
              Creating the stakeholder map allows us to evaluate: <br />- who
              are most interested / benefits the most from the system? <br />-
              What problems should we prioritize to eliminate the current
              painpoints for the main user group? <br />- who is responsible for
              managing and maintaining the system, and why are they incentized
              to do so?
            </p>
            <p>
              <br /><b>Storyboarding</b> <br />We then proceeded to making key
              interaction scenarios using storyboards. These storyboards are
              shows the desired solution for each problem faced by users
              currently. They are closely related to the desired outcome that
              our solution will bring to the problem context.

            <p>
              <br /><b>Design</b> <br />
              We choose a dynamic calendar design that allows the transparency
              of work shifts from worker to worker and between the manager and
              workers.We also consider that the user familarity with IOS and
              Google calendar design, which can help users quickly learn to use
              the system.

            <p>
              <br />
              <b>Value Creation</b>
              <br />The key features of Shwift satisfy the needs of both
              employees and managers. Instant company-wide requesting helps
              employees find a swap as soon as possible while the point
              incentive system motivates employees to accept swap requests. To
              streamline the process, we also have an algorithm that
              automatically matches employees based on their schedules.<br />
              For managers, they are now able to monitor their staffsâ€™ schedules
              all on one page and easily track swaps through swap notifications
              and swap overview.
